      <h3>What i have learnt so far and how css is important</h3>
      <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics.I learnt that CSS is important for web designers and it controls how web pages look.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Padding controls how much breathing room exists within a box</td>
            <td>Margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box.</td>
            <td>Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual width otherwise, it’s zero.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box.</td>
            <td>Margins, on the other hand, are essentially invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen</td>
